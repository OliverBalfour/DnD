# Dungeons and Dragons Map Tools

Requires git and a recent node.js release.

`git clone https://github.com/Tobsta/DnD.git`

`cd DnD`

`npm install`

`node index`

Visit `http://localhost:3000/` on the server or `http://[LOCAL_IP]:3000` for other machines on the same wifi network. Only works if the network does not have port blocking firewalls. DM enters DM password printed in server terminal to have draw access to the map, everyone else can just view the map in realtime.
